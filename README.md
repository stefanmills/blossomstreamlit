# SPJ Savings and Loans - Loan Default Prediction Model

This repository is part of a collaborative project created by four brilliant Data Analysts for the **Blossom Academy Data Fair Hackathon Challenge**. Our challenge was to develop predictive models to assess the likelihood of loan default, offering valuable insights for **SPJ Savings and Loans**, a fictional financial institution.

### Project Overview

The dataset provided offers essential information about loan applicants and their characteristics. Our primary goal is to build robust predictive models to determine the likelihood of loan defaults while also generating actionable insights for SPJ Savings and Loans. This will assist the bank in making informed lending decisions and fostering economic empowerment.

### About SPJ Savings and Loans

**SPJ Savings and Loans** is a distinguished financial institution with a commitment to empowering women and youth. The company aligns itself with the **United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly:

- **SDG 1**: No Poverty
- **SDG 5**: Gender Equality
- **SDG 8**: Decent Work and Economic Growth

By utilizing our model, the company aims to facilitate accessible loan disbursement options that nurture entrepreneurship and help foster economic growth.

### The Journey

Our code takes you on a detailed journey through the entire process:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Ensuring the dataset is clean and ready for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Discovering patterns and trends in the data to inform our predictive modeling.
3. **Predictive Modeling**: Building a machine learning model to identify individuals who are likely to default on loans.

We have made it a priority to explain each step in the code using clear comments and detailed markdown, providing a full picture of the process for anyone looking to understand or replicate our work.

### Code & Files

The **Jupyter Notebook (Credit_Risk_Hackaton_ML.ipynb)** file contains all the code, explanations, and model insights. Feel free to explore it to understand how we tackled the challenge, from data cleaning to building the final predictive model.
